/**
 * Expense — the one money event nothing in the app produces on its own.
 *
 * Sales, refunds, payouts, fees and labels all have a document behind them
 * already. Rent, salaries and advertising have none, so without this the profit
 * figure is revenue minus the handful of costs that happen to pass through a
 * gateway — which is not a profit figure at all.
 *
 * Entered by hand, and therefore editable, which makes it the one financial
 * record that is NOT append-only. The ledger stays append-only regardless: an
 * edit posts a reversal and a fresh pair of entries rather than rewriting
 * history, so a corrected expense leaves both versions visible.
 *
 * Scoped by `book`: a marketplace owner's rent belongs to the marketplace, the
 * cost of stock for their own shop belongs to the own store, and a
 * single-vendor install only ever writes the own book.
