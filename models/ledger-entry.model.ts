/**
 * LedgerEntry — the append-only spine every financial report is a grouping of.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: the operational documents (Order, Payout,
 * PlatformPayment, Shipment) are mutable, so a report derived from them changes
 * whenever one of them is corrected. Last month's profit is supposed to be a
 * fact. Recording each money event once, as an entry that is never edited,
 * is what makes it one.
 *
 * Three properties carry the whole design:
 *
 * **Append-only.** Nothing here is updated or deleted. A mistake is fixed by
 * posting its reverse, which leaves both the error and the correction visible —
 * the audit trail is a side effect of the rule rather than a feature on top.
 *
 * **Two-sided.** Every entry names a debit account and a credit account from
 * the fixed enum in lib/finance/accounts.ts. Because both sides are always
 * present and equal, the trial balance is free: sum every entry by account,
 * apply the sign, and the total must be zero. A non-zero total is a bug alarm
 * no test could otherwise raise.
 *
 * **Idempotent.** `key` is derived from the source event, not from the clock,
 * and is unique. A replayed webhook, a re-run backfill and a retried cron all
 * try to write the same key and lose to the index — which is what makes it safe
 * to post from paths that are themselves retried.
 *
 * The ledger is DERIVED. It never gates an operational write: an order must not
 * fail to exist because its entries could not be posted, so posting is
 * best-effort and anything missed is recoverable by replaying the source
 * through the same rules (scripts/backfill-ledger.mjs).
