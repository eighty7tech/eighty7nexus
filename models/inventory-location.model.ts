/**
 * A merchant's physical place: a warehouse, a shop floor, a collection counter.
 *
 * ONE entity for every kind, distinguished by what it can do rather than by
 * which table it lives in. A warehouse stocks inventory and admits nobody; a
 * shop front does both; a market stall might take collections while holding no
 * counted stock at all. Pickup branches used to live separately, embedded on
 * the vendor document, which meant the same physical address was described
 * twice and the two descriptions drifted — and neither knew about the other, so
 * "collect from where the stock is" was not expressible.
 *
 * `pickupEnabled` is the flag that answers the question a warehouse must answer
 * "no" to: **may the public walk in here?** Deriving that from stock instead
 * would publish every fulfilment centre as a collection point.
 *
 * Locations are **per vendor**, not platform-wide. A marketplace vendor keeps
 * their own stock in their own places, and one vendor must never see, rename,
 * or draw stock from another's. In single-vendor mode the admin acts as the
 * default vendor (see `lib/multi-vendor.ts`), so the same model serves both
 * modes with no branching.
 *
 * `vendorId` is deliberately **not** `required`: documents written before the
 * field existed must keep loading, and a legacy row must survive an ordinary
 * `.save()` (a rename) rather than failing validation. Reads tolerate the gap —
 * see `lib/inventory-location-scope.ts` — and `scripts/backfill-location-vendor.ts`
 * assigns an owner to every existing row.
