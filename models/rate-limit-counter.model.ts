 * Rate Limit Counter

 * limit means the same thing no matter which app instance answers the request
 * — an in-process counter multiplies the effective limit by the number of
 * instances and lets a caller dodge it by landing on a different one.
 *
 * Documents are disposable: the TTL index below reaps them once their window
 * has passed, so the collection stays roughly "active windows" in size and
 * needs no cleanup job.
