// Indexes
// Compound indexes match the real list-query shapes (filter field + createdAt

// an in-memory sort over a filtered collection scan. Each compound's leading
// field also serves the equality-only lookups, so the former single-field
// {customerId}, {status}, {paymentStatus}, {subOrders.vendorId} indexes are
// redundant prefixes and have been folded in. (Drop those stale single-field
// indexes from existing databases via a migration — Mongoose autoIndex only
// creates, it never drops.)
