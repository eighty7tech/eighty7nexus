/**
 * FiscalPeriod — the line under a month.
 *
 * Once figures have been filed, quoted to an accountant or paid tax on, they
 * have to stop moving. Nothing in the app prevents a late webhook, a corrected
 * expense or a re-run backfill from posting into last March; a closed period
 * says those entries land in the open month instead.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a lock on the data. Ledger entries are append-only and are
 * never edited or deleted by this — closing changes only where NEW entries are
 * dated, so history is preserved rather than defended. That distinction matters
 * when someone asks why a figure moved: the answer is a dated entry in the
 * current month, not a silent difference in a closed one.
 *
 * One row per closed period. The absence of a row means open, so a store that
 * never closes anything carries no state at all.
