/**
 * The last time each background job actually ran.
 *
 * Exists because the alternative is a class of failure with no symptom. The
 * eight jobs in `vercel.json` are what send queued messages, hand shipments to
 * carriers, expire boosts and post the ledger — and on a Vercel Hobby plan the
 * schedule that drives them is silently truncated, so most of them never fire.
 * Nothing errors. The store looks healthy and outbound messages simply never
 * leave, until a customer asks why nobody replied.
 *
 * A row per job, written by the job itself. `lib/cron/health.ts` compares the
 * stamp against the interval the job is supposed to keep and raises the ones
 * that have gone quiet.
