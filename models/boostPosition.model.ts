/**
 * BoostPosition Model
 * One rung of the GLOBAL sponsored-placement ladder. Position N renders at
 * visual slot N on every placement deep enough to show it; an unsold rung is
 * filled by a regular product and NEVER compacts upward — compaction would let
 * every vendor buy the cheapest rung and still land on top, collapsing the
 * price ladder. The ladder is global: not per-category, not per-placement.
 *
 * A vendor buys one rung for a date range at `pricePerDay`. The purchase
 * instance is a BoostCampaign; the inventory it consumes is one BoostSlotDay
 * row per booked day.
