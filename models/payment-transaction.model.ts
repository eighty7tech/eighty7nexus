/**
 * One consignment's slice of a refund, split the way the sale was.
 *
 * A refund row used to carry only `grossAmount`, so the ledger and the payout
 * engine each had to re-derive what that number was made of — and both did it
 * by prorating across the whole order, which is right only when the refund is
 * genuinely "X% of everything". A return never is. Recording the split at the
 * moment the money moves makes it a fact rather than an inference, and one
 * both engines can read.
 *
 * Absent on order-level refunds, which have no item context to split by, and
 * on every refund written before this existed. Those still prorate.
