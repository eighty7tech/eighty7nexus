/**
 * Commission the platform is owed on sales a merchant collected themselves.
 *
 * A payout hands a vendor their share of money the platform already holds. For
 * a cash sale that direction does not exist — the merchant took the notes at
 * their own counter — so the commission cannot be deducted from anything, and
 * before this it was simply never collected. `lib/payment-custody.ts` decides
 * which sales those are.
 *
 * This is the DEBT, not a payment attempt. It sits alongside `BoostCampaign`
 * and `VendorSubscription` as a thing a `PlatformPayment` pays for, and for the
 * same reason: a vendor who abandons one checkout and completes another leaves
 * two attempts behind, and neither the amount owed nor the sales it covers may
 * move because of that. One debt, many attempts.
 *
 * The sub-orders it covers are CLAIMED by stamping `commissionSettlementId` on
 * each of them, which is what takes them out of the owed balance. `orderIds`
 * here is the frozen record of what was billed; the stamps are what the balance
 * query actually reads.
