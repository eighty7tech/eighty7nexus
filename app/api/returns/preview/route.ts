/**
 * What a return would be worth, without creating one.
 *
 * The shopper picks the items and the reason, and the reason is what decides
 * whether the delivery comes back and whether the return leg is charged — so
 * quoting the figure only after submission told them the one thing they needed
 * before it. This answers the same question the submission does, from the same
 * planner, so the number shown is the number they get.
 *
 * A POST because the selection is a body, not because anything is written:
 * no lock is taken, no return number is drawn, nothing is persisted.
