/**
 * POST /api/payments/paypal/webhook
 *
 * PayPal had no webhook at all, which meant a refund issued from the PayPal
 * dashboard reached Eighty7Nexus nowhere: no transaction row, no ledger entry, the
 * order still reading as fully paid, and the vendor still paid out for a sale
 * the shopper already had their money back for. A refund that PayPal later
 * cancelled was equally invisible in the other direction.
 *
 * Only refund events are handled here. Captures already arrive through the
 * client-side capture call, which is authoritative because it fetches the
 * order from PayPal itself; adding a second path for them would be two ways to
 * finalize one payment.
