 * Money the platform moved between its own accounts. Settling a gateway balance

 * do nothing but fall below zero.
 *
 * A balance that has gone impossible. A liability below zero means more was
 * handed over than was ever owed. The entries behind it are facts and the
 * ledger is append-only, so what resolves it is another entry, not an edit.
 *
 * Posted in the same request rather than fire-and-forget, for the same reason
 * an expense is: the entry is the entire point of the call, so failing to write
 * it is failing to do what was asked, and the admin should hear so.
