 * on who opened it, and the impact check has to follow the same split.
 *
 * Without this the admin path failed its permission check, the client swallowed
 * the error, and an admin unpublishing a booked product released every future
 * day with no warning at all — the precise outcome the confirmation exists to
 * prevent, silently, for the role most likely to do it.
