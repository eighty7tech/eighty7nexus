 *              FRESH install still gets the starter seeded as its draft:
 *              there is nothing to keep.)
 * - `draft`  — the starter replaces the DRAFT; shoppers see nothing until
 *              the admin publishes from Customize.
 * - `publish`— the starter goes live immediately. The layout it replaces is
 *              pushed onto version history, so it is one click to restore.
