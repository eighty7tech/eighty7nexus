/**
 * Inventory locations for the caller's own store.
 *
 * One endpoint serves all three dashboards — admin, staff, and vendor — because
 * every one of them (product form, POS, transfers, settings) needs the same
 * list, and duplicating the CRUD would mean two surfaces to keep in step. What
 * differs is *whose* locations come back: `resolveLocationScope` answers that
 * once, and every query here goes through it. A vendor sees only their own
 * places; an admin sees the house store's; staff see what they are scoped to.
 *
 * Managing your own locations is an inherent right of an approved merchant, so
 * there is no separate permission for it — a vendor who can list products can
 * say where those products are kept.
