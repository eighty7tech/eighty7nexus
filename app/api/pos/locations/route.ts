 * The POS page ships this list with the server render, which is enough for the
 * shift-start question but not for the rest of a shift: a register is left open
 * for hours, and an admin can deactivate a branch or take a counter off the till
 * while a cashier is standing at it. Without a way to re-ask, the terminal would
 * keep decrementing a closed branch until someone reloaded the tab.
 *
 * Deliberately the same `listPOSLocations` the server render uses, so a refresh
 * can never widen what the page was originally allowed to show.
