/**
 * GET /api/vendor/subscription/payments
 *
 * The signed-in vendor's own plan invoice history — the evidence behind the
 * billing page. GET /api/vendor/subscription returns the live subscription and
 * nothing else, so a vendor who has paid nine periods through three different
 * gateways could not see any of them; only an admin could, through the twin at
 * /api/admin/vendors/[id]/subscription/payments.
 *
 * The vendor is resolved from the session rather than from the path, so there
 * is no id here to tamper with: a vendor can only ever read their own history.
 *
 * Rows are keyed by `vendorId` (indexed as `{ vendorId, createdAt }`) rather
 * than by subscription, so a vendor who changed plans — or switched gateway,
 * which rewrites the live subscription's provider — keeps one continuous
 * billing history instead of one fragment per subscription record.
