/**
 * DELETE /api/vendor/boosts/campaigns/[id]
 * Cancel a booking that has not started yet.
 *
 * Restricted to `scheduled`. An `active` booking is mid-flight — part of it has
 * already rendered — and letting a vendor pull it themselves turns every
 * disappointing day into a self-service refund dispute; those go through the
 * marketplace.
 *
 * The reason this exists at all: bookings run up to 60 days out on a per-day
 * refund basis, so "email support to cancel" leaves the marketplace sitting on
 * inventory it cannot resell until a human intervenes. Cancelling here puts
 * every booked day straight back on the calendar.
