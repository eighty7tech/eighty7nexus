 * What unpublishing or archiving this product would cost: the booked days that
 * would go back on the calendar, and the credit they represent.
 *
 * The release itself is immediate and irreversible — a released day is on sale
 * again the same second, and a competitor can take it before the vendor changes
 * their mind — so the vendor has to see the number BEFORE they commit. That is
 * the whole reason this endpoint exists rather than a toast afterwards.
 *
 * Boosting off, no bookings, or no permission all answer the same empty shape,
 * so the caller never has to branch on the feature being enabled.
