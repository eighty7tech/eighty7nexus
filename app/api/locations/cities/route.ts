 * GET /api/locations/cities
 *
 * Cities with sellable products, for the storefront location picker. Public and
 * anonymous — a shopper chooses where they are before they have an account.
 *
 * Only cities whose vendors publish a location appear here; vendors set to
 * `hidden` are excluded upstream, so this never turns the picker into a way to
 * discover an address a seller chose not to publish.
 *
 * `?q=` narrows the list and `?limit=` caps it. Both are optional: without them
 * the picker still gets a sensible first page rather than every city on the
 * marketplace, which on a large one is a payload no popover needs.
