/**
 * POST /api/upload/presigned
 * Generate presigned URLs for direct client-to-storage uploads.
 *
 * Why this path exists: POST /api/upload streams the bytes through the app
 * server, which caps uploads at the hosting platform's request-body limit
 * (4.5MB on Vercel) regardless of the storage settings. Product photos and
 * videos routinely exceed that, so they failed in production while working
 * locally, where no such limit applies. Handing the browser a presigned PUT
 * lets the file go straight to R2/S3 and removes the ceiling entirely.
 *
 * Local storage has no presigned equivalent — the response says so via
 * `supportsDirectUpload: false` so the client can fall back to /api/upload
 * instead of surfacing an error.
