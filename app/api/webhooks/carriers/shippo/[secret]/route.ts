/**
 * Shippo tracking + transaction callbacks.
 *
 * Shippo documents no HMAC signature, so origin is established in three layers,
 * none of which is sufficient alone:
 *
 *  1. The secret in the URL path, compared as a sha256 digest in constant time.
 *  2. We never trust the body. Only the object id and the `test` flag are read;
 *     the worker then re-fetches the authoritative state from Shippo with OUR
 *     token. A forger who obtains the URL therefore achieves nothing beyond
 *     making us poll our own account.
 *  3. The event must map to a shipment we own, in the matching mode — a live
 *     event may not touch a test parcel, or the reverse.
 *
 * Shippo requires a 2XX within three seconds and retries only twice, so the
 * handler does nothing inline beyond leasing and enqueueing.
