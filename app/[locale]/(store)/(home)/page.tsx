/**
 * The home page renders whatever the theme engine's home document (or, until
 * the migration runs, the mapped legacy `settings.homePage`) says: an ordered
 * list of section instances resolved against the section registry.
 *
 * Only the PUBLISHED state renders here — draft preview lives on its own
 * admin-gated /draft route, so this page never touches a request API and
 * stays fully cacheable for shoppers.
 *
 * It is deliberately **not** location-filtered.
 *
 * Every other listing narrows to the shopper's place, but this page is the
 * storefront's shop window: its job is to show the breadth of the catalogue,
 * and filtering it to one city empties most of the strips a store spent effort
 * curating. A shopper who wants "near me" reaches the filtered listings one
 * click away, where the location banner explains what is being narrowed.
 *
 * The header carries no location control either: the picker lives on the
 * listings it narrows (/products and vendor sidebars/sheets, a pill above the
 * category and pre-order grids), and the choice made there follows the shopper
 * to every page that does filter.
