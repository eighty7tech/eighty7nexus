/**
 * The house store's shops, warehouses and collection points.
 *
 * The admin counterpart of `/vendor/locations`, and gated the same way: on
 * being able to manage inventory, not on POS. This list used to exist only in
 * two half-places — a cut-down tab under Settings that could edit four of the
 * record's fields, and the full editor buried under POS, which redirects away
 * entirely when the register is switched off. An admin with POS disabled was
 * therefore left with the cut-down one, unable to publish a collection point,
 * set opening hours, or place a map pin, with nothing on screen to say so.
 *
 * `/admin/pos/locations` redirects here.
