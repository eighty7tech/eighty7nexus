 *
 * `multiVendor` decides whether a cost can be filed against the marketplace
 * book at all. On a single-vendor install there is only one book, so the choice
 * is not shown and everything lands in the own store's accounts.
 *
 * The period is resolved here, above the client that lists against it: the
 * screen had none at all, so "total for this filter" quietly meant every
 * expense the store had ever recorded, under a list that looked like a month.
