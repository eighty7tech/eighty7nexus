/**
 * Who owes whom, per vendor.
 *
 * The two directions are shown together because they offset. A vendor who
 * delivers with their own fleet takes the cash and owes commission; the same
 * vendor may also have gateway-settled orders the platform is holding money
 * for. Paying out the gross while chasing the commission separately is how a
 * marketplace ends up lending to its own sellers, so the settlement figure is
 * the net and it is the column that reads first.
 *
 * Marketplace-only by construction: there are no vendors to owe anything on a
 * single-vendor store, so the screen redirects rather than rendering an empty
 * table of concepts that do not apply.
