/**
 * A vendor's own shops, warehouses and collection points.
 *
 * Deliberately gated on nothing but being a merchant with dashboard access.
 * This list used to live only under POS, which meant a store with the register
 * switched off — or a vendor without `access_pos` — had no way at all to say
 * where their stock is kept, even though inventory, the product form, the
 * dispatch order and storefront pickup all read it. `/api/admin/locations`
 * already takes that stance ("no separate permission for it"); this page is
 * what makes the UI agree with it.
 *
 * No `required` permissions are passed, so the guard returns rather than
 * redirects for a vendor still behind the payment gate — hence the explicit
 * `hasDashboardAccess` check, which is the same redirect a permission-naming
 * caller would have got.
