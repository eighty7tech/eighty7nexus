/**
 * Keeps a JSON endpoint fresh without holding a connection open.
 *
 * This replaces the `text/event-stream` routes the notification surfaces used
 * to hold open. Those were never push: the server polled Mongo on a 3s timer
 * per connection and forwarded a snapshot when its signature changed. Moving
 * that same poll to the client loses no freshness and costs no held-open
 * request — which matters on a serverless host, where an idle dashboard tab
 * was billing a running function and consuming one of the connections the
 * checkout path shares (`MONGODB_MAX_POOL_SIZE`).
 *
 * Freshness comes from four signals rather than a fast interval:
 *
 * - **interval** — a slow background tick (30s), only while the tab is visible.
 * - **visibility / focus** — an immediate refetch when the user comes back.
 *   This is what makes a slow interval feel live: nobody perceives staleness
 *   in a tab they are not looking at, and the data is current the instant they
 *   look again.
 * - **online** — an immediate refetch when the network returns.
 * - **push** — a `push` handled by the service worker messages every open tab
 *   (see `public/sw.js`), which refetches at once. Once push is known to be
 *   working the interval drops to 60s, because the timer is then only a
 *   backstop for events push did not cover.
 *
 * Requests carry `If-None-Match`; a `304` leaves `data` untouched, so a poll
 * that finds nothing new costs one indexed lookup instead of a full payload
 * (see `lib/api/etag.ts`). The tag is held here rather than left to the HTTP
 * cache on purpose: these payloads are per-user and go out `no-store`, so the
 * browser would never revalidate them on its own.
