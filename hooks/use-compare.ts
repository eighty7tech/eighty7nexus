/**
 * Compare tray
 *
 * What a shopper has picked out to compare, while they are still browsing.
 * The COMPARISON ITSELF is not stored anywhere: `/compare` renders from its
 * `?products=` query so a comparison stays shareable, reload-proof and
 * undoable with the back button. This tray is only the collector that gets
 * them there — pick on a listing, then follow the bar to the page.
 *
 * Slugs, not ids, because the URL the tray builds is addressed by slug.
