 * breaks is the three places the terminal reaches the network: resolving a
 * scan, refetching the grid on a filter change, and submitting the sale.
 *
 * The service worker also keeps the POS document, so the terminal survives a
 * reload with no connection. That is bounded by the offline session window
 * (`lib/pos/offline-session.ts`): the register locks once too long has passed
