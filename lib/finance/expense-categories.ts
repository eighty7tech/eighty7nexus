/**
 * Expense categories.
 *
 * A fixed list, like the chart of accounts and for the same reason: every
 * category maps to a ledger account, and a category a buyer could delete would
 * leave expenses pointing at nothing. What a store actually wants to vary is
 * the WORDING, and that is translation, not configuration.
 *
 * The list is deliberately short. A dozen recognisable buckets is what makes a
 * profit and loss readable; thirty makes it a data-entry chore and every report
 * a long tail of ones. `other` exists so nothing is unrecordable, and a store
 * that leans on it heavily has told you which bucket to add next.

 * for resale is not spending money, it is converting cash into an asset, and
 * the cost belongs on the profit and loss when the goods are SOLD. That posting
 * already existed (`cost_of_goods` ← `inventory`, from the line-level cost
 * snapshot), so filing the purchase as an operating expense meant a store that
 * recorded both had the same goods charged against profit on the way in and
 * again on the way out — while `inventory` itself, credited on every sale and
 * debited by nothing, fell further below zero with each one.
