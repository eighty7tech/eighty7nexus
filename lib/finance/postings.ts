 *    leave the vendor holding money the platform has already handed back;
 *  - shipping reverses SHIPPING INCOME. It used to be lumped into merchandise
 *    and clawed out of the vendor's payable, which charged a vendor for
 *    delivery revenue they never received and left shipping income standing at
 *    full value on an order that was refunded in whole;
 *  - tax and duty reverse their liabilities, because that money was never the
