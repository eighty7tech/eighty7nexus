/**
 * Reports, as groupings of the ledger.
 *
 * Every figure here comes from LedgerEntry and nothing else. That is the whole
 * return on building the spine: a profit and loss is one aggregation, not a
 * re-derivation of custody, discount and refund rules that would drift from the
 * ones the posting layer already applied.
 *
 * Two rules the numbers depend on:
 *
 * **Never sum across currencies.** Every total is grouped by the currency it
 * was recorded in. Adding UGX to USD produces a number denominated in nothing,
 * and it is the failure mode this module exists to avoid — the old sales
 * roll-up did exactly that and said so in its own comment.
 *
 * **GMV is not revenue.** On a marketplace the merchandise flowing through the
 * platform mostly belongs to vendors, so it is reported as its own figure,
 * beside revenue and never inside it.
