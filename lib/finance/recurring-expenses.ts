/**
 * Recurring expenses: the copies a template owes.
 *
 * Rent, salaries and hosting arrive on a schedule, and re-typing them every
 * month is how a store's costs quietly stop being recorded. A template is just
 * an expense with `recurring.enabled`; this creates the next copy when it falls
 * due and moves the template's clock forward.
 *
 * **Catches up rather than skipping.** A store whose cron was down for two
 * months gets both months, each dated when it was actually due — not one row
 * dated today. That is the difference between a ledger that matches reality and
 * one that matches the uptime of a cron.
