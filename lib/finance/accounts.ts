 * The chart of accounts, fixed in code.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a collection the admin can edit. Every posting rule names
 * two of these constants; the moment a buyer could rename or delete one, a rule
 * would point at nothing and the ledger would start recording entries against
 * an account that no report knows about. Display names are translated like any
 * other string — what is frozen is the identifier, not the wording.
 *
 * Each account has a TYPE, and the type is what makes a report possible without
 * anyone writing a report-specific query: income minus expense is the profit,
 * assets minus liabilities is the position. It also fixes the sign convention,
 * which is the part people get wrong: a debit increases an asset or an expense
 * and decreases everything else.
