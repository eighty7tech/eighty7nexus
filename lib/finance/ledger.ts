/**
 * Writing to the ledger.
 *
 * Two rules, and both are about what happens when something goes wrong:
 *
 * **Posting never fails the caller.** These functions are called from checkout
 * completion, webhooks and cron ticks. An order that a shopper has paid for
 * must exist even if its entries could not be written — the entries are
 * recoverable by replaying the source document through the same rules, the
 * order is not. So `postLedgerEntries` logs and returns rather than throwing,
 * and every call site treats it as fire-and-forget.
 *
 * **Every write is idempotent.** Keys are derived from the source event, so the
 * unique index absorbs replays. That is what makes the recovery above safe:
 * re-running a backfill over history cannot double-count, because every entry
 * it would write is an entry that already exists.
