/**
 * Reusable sliders — the shared vocabulary.
 *
 * A Slider is an admin-authored, store-wide resource (like a Menu): a named
 * group of slides that content blocks reference BY HANDLE instead of owning
 * their own slide copies. This module is deliberately pure — no server, no
 * component imports — so the admin editor, the storefront renderer, and the
 * write-path normalizer all share one contract and the tamper-proofing is
 * unit-testable.
 *
 * The money invariant carries over from the slideshow section: a slide has NO
 * price field. `productId` binds a product; price resolves server-side at
 * render, so a slide can never advertise a stale or invented figure.
