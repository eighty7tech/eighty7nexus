/**
 * Locating one saved address inside a shopper's `User.addresses` array.

 * Addresses used to be addressed purely by array position, which is only stable
 * for as long as nobody edits the list: deleting an address in one tab shifts
 * every later index in another, so a concurrent edit or set-default landed on
 * whichever address slid into that slot. The sub-schema now carries an `_id`.
 *
 * Entries written before that change have no `_id`, and none is minted for them
 * retroactively — a backfill would have to run before the deploy that needs it,
 * and getting that order wrong breaks every saved address at once. So both
 * forms are accepted here instead, with the id preferred whenever it is present.
 * A legacy entry gains an id the first time it is rewritten.
 */
