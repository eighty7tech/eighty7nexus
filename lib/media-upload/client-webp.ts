/**
 * Browser-side image preparation for direct-to-storage uploads.
 *
 * The server pipeline (lib/media-upload/webp.ts) re-encodes every image to
 * WebP with sharp and records its dimensions. Direct-to-storage uploads never
 * reach the server, so that step has to happen here or uploads would regress
 * to storing originals with no width/height.
 *
 * Canvas gives us both: `toBlob("image/webp")` re-encodes, and the decoded
 * bitmap carries the dimensions. Quality 0.82 matches the sharp setting so the
 * two paths produce comparably sized files.
 *
 * Anything this module cannot handle (unsupported codec, no WebP encoder,
 * a decode failure) resolves to `null` — callers fall back to the original
 * file rather than blocking the upload.

/**
 * Images the browser must not re-encode.
 *
 * SVG is vector — rasterizing it to WebP would destroy the thing that makes it
 * useful (and taints the canvas in some browsers). The server pipeline skips
 * SVG for the same reason, so both paths store the original.
 *
 * GIF is here because a canvas only ever holds ONE frame: re-encoding an
 * animated GIF produced a still image of its first frame, silently killing the
 * animation. sharp does handle animated input (`animated: true`), so the server
 * path converts GIFs to animated WebP; the browser has no equivalent, and
 * storing the original animation beats storing a frozen frame.
 *
 * ICO is the mirror image: the browser CAN decode it but the server cannot
 * (libvips ships without the codec — see undecodableImageType), so the server
 * path stores the original. A favicon uploaded as .ico must land as .ico
 * whichever path carried it, not as a WebP that older browsers ignore.
