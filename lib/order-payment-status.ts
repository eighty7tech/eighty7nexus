 *
 *   - `lib/shipping/carriers/build-request.ts` stopped flagging COD, so the

 *   - `lib/vendor-earnings.ts` made the sibling's sub-order payable, and
 *     raised a commission debt against a vendor who was holding no cash.
 *
 * Deliberately free of `server-only` and of any import beyond the config
 * enums, exactly as `lib/payment-custody.ts` is: the rule is asserted in tests
 * and needed by both plain object checks and Mongo queries.
