 * Sign out, and take the register's cached page with it.
 *
 * The service worker keeps the POS document so a till survives a reload with
 * no connection (`public/sw.js`). On a counter tablet the next person to sign
 * in is often a different cashier — and on a multi-vendor install, a different
 * merchant — so a shell left behind could serve one tenant's server-rendered
 * catalogue to the next user the first time they open the register offline.
 * Signing out is the moment that stops being the same session, so it is the
 * moment the shell has to go.
 *
 * Wrapped here rather than at each call site because there are already half a
 * dozen of them and a future one would have no reason to know about any of
 * this.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT cleared: the offline outbox. Those are completed
 * sales whose money is in the drawer and which the server has not accepted
 * yet. They are keyed by an idempotency key and belong to the store, not to
 * whoever happens to be signed in — dropping them at sign-out would destroy
 * takings. They sync on the next authenticated session.
