/**
 * Which branch a posted order leaves from.
 *
 * Pickup answers this by itself — the shopper picked a counter, and that is
 * where the goods must be. Delivery has no such signal, so the merchant
 * configures one: an ordered list of the places they dispatch from, tried in
 * turn. Shopify calls the same thing a fulfillment priority list.
 *
 * An ordered list rather than "nearest branch to the delivery address": nearest
 * needs every customer address geocoded, produces a different answer for two
 * orders that look identical to the merchant, and splits an order across
 * branches to satisfy an optimum nobody asked for. "Try the warehouse, then the
 * shop" is one drag-to-reorder control, and a merchant can predict it.
 *
 * **This module is the only place the rule lives.** Two things read it — the
 * stock decrement (`lib/inventory.ts`) and the stamp that records the answer on
 * the order (`lib/order-inventory.ts`) — and they run at different moments, so
 * a second copy of the rule is a guarantee that the ledger and the paperwork
 * eventually disagree about where an order shipped from.
