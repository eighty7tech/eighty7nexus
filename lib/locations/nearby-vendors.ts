/**
 * Resolve a shopper's location to the vendors whose products they should see.
 *
 * Products carry no location of their own — a product is where its vendor is —
 * so every location-filtered product query runs in two steps: resolve the
 * location to vendor ids here, then constrain `Product.vendorId` to them.
 *
 * Two ways in, because branch data is uneven:
 *
 * - **radius** — `$near` over a collection point's `geo`. Exact, ordered
 *   nearest-first, and what the picker's distance slider drives. It measures
 *   from the place a shopper would walk into, NOT from the vendor's registered
 *   address: that one exists for payouts and KYC, and is routinely an office or
 *   a home in another city.
 * - **city name** — for merchants none of whose branches are geocoded. Without
 *   it they would be unreachable through the filter no matter how wide the
 *   radius, which silently hides part of the catalogue.
 *
 * Both are constrained to approved, live stores. Public address visibility
 * never changes where a vendor's products are eligible to appear.
