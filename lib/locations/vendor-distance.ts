/**
 * Label a product card with how far away it can be collected, and make sure no

 *
 * The distance is **not** computed here. It comes from `findNearbyVendors`,
 * already measured from the merchant's nearest collection point — the place a
 * shopper would walk into. Measuring it here instead, from the vendor's own
 * `address.geo`, is what this module used to do and it was wrong: that address
 * is collected for payouts and KYC, and is routinely an accountant's office or
 * a home in another city. A grid could then filter to 5 km on a branch two
 * streets away and print "48 km" on the very same card.
 *
 * What stays here is the privacy boundary. `lib/vendor-address.ts` is explicit
 * that the address exists for payouts rather than for publication: the default
 * `city_country` precision is chosen so a vendor trading from home is legible
 * as a business *without exposing a doorstep*, and a `[lng, lat]` pair at seven
 * decimal places is a doorstep. So any point that rode along on a populated
 * vendor is consumed here and never survives into the returned object. Every
 * listing that renders distance goes through this function — that is the whole
 * reason it exists as one small module rather than inline in the grid.
