 * "Can I collect this one, near me?" — answered on the product page.
 *
 * The grid answers a coarser question: the card badge says this seller keeps a
 * counter in range. On the page for a single item that is no longer good
 * enough, because the shopper is about to decide, and the difference between
 * "this shop is near you" and "your size is on that shop's shelf" is the whole
 * point of collecting rather than waiting for a courier.
 *
 * Resolved server-side, on its own small query, rather than by handing the
 * browser the per-branch counts to work it out. Those counts are a merchant's
 * operational data — how much of what sits in which shop — and publishing them
 * on every product page would let a competitor read the lot with a page fetch.
