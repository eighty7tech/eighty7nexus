/**
 * What the gateway kept.
 *
 * `PaymentTransaction.feeAmount` has existed since the payments feature shipped
 * and every write site hardcoded it to 0, which made `netAmount` a second name
 * for gross and every "net revenue" figure in the product a gross one. A
 * marketplace loses 2–3% of turnover here; on the P&L that is usually larger
 * than any single operating expense.
 *
 * Two things make this fiddly enough to deserve its own module, and both are
 * why the mappers are pure and individually tested:
 *
 * **Units differ per gateway.** Paystack and Razorpay report subunits (kobo,
 * paise), PayPal reports a decimal string, Stripe reports minor units of its
 * BALANCE currency. Reading any of them as a plain number is off by a factor of
 * 100 in the direction that flatters the report.
 *
 * **The fee currency is not always the charge currency.** Stripe settles in the
 * account's balance currency, so a EUR charge on a USD account is billed a USD
 * fee. The pair is therefore carried together and the caller decides what to do
 * when they disagree — never silently subtracted from an amount in another
 * currency.
