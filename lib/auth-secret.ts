/**
 * Startup validation for the Better Auth signing secret.
 *
 * Better Auth only hard-fails on its own sentinel string, so any other value —
 * including the placeholder shipped in `.env.example` — is accepted with a
 * console warning nobody reads. That matters more here than in a normal app:
 * Eighty7Nexus is distributed as source, so a placeholder left unchanged is a secret
 * every other buyer already has, and forged session, OAuth-state, and
 * trust-device cookies follow.
 *
 * Production therefore refuses to boot on a weak secret; development only
 * warns, so a fresh clone still runs before the buyer has written a `.env`.
