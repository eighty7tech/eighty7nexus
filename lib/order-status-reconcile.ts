/**
 * Put the order-level status back in step with its consignments.
 *
 * A parent transition writes the order and its sub-orders in one `$set`, but
 * the cascade deliberately refuses to touch consignments that have already
 * shipped or overtaken the target (`protectedSubOrderStatuses`). So the two
 * halves of that write can legitimately disagree: cancelling a split order in
 * which one vendor has delivered cancels the vendor who had not, and the order
 * is then not a cancelled order — it is a delivered one with a cancelled part.
 *
 * Left alone, that disagreement is exactly the bug this whole change is about,
 * only inverted: the order-level badge would claim a cancellation the goods
 * never had. So the status is re-derived from what the write actually left
 * behind, and corrected in a second small update.
 *
 * Timestamps come from the sub-orders rather than the clock. Reconciliation
 * happens some time after the event it is describing, and `deliveredAt` means
 * when the goods arrived, not when the paperwork caught up.
