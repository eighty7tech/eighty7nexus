 * the Settings page has to be the exact URL Better Auth will send. That URL is
 * derived from the server's auth base URL — `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, else
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` — which the browser cannot see, and which is not
 * necessarily the host the admin happens to be browsing on (a store reached
 * through a preview domain, a tunnel, or an IP would otherwise print a callback
 * that can never work).
 *
 * So the server resolves the base URL and publishes it in the settings payload,
 * and both sides build the callback from the same two functions here.
