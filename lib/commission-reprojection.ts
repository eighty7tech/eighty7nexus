/**
 * Making a commission-rate change reach the vendors it should.
 *
 * `Vendor.commission` is an enforcement cache: the money path reads that number
 * and never re-derives it, which is what keeps orders inert to plan lookups.
 * The cost is that changing a rate in Settings did nothing at all to vendors who
 * already existed — only accounts onboarded afterwards ever saw it. An admin
 * raising the platform rate got silence, with no way to fix it but editing every
 * vendor by hand.
 *
 * The reason it was never simply swept is that `commission` is a bare number: a
 * bulk update cannot see the difference between a rate that is merely the store
 * default and one an admin negotiated for a single merchant, and would quietly
 * erase the second. `Vendor.commissionSource` is what makes the distinction
 * legible, so this sweep can move the defaults and leave every override alone.
 *
 * Plans are deliberately NOT swept. A subscriber's rate is frozen on their
 * subscription (`commissionRateSnapshot`) as the terms they signed up under —
 * the same grandfathering `boostTerms` gives a boost — so editing a plan's rate
 * changes what NEW subscribers get, not what existing ones are charged.
