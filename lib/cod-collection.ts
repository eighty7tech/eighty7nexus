 * Who takes the cash on a cash-on-delivery sale.
 *
 * `lib/payment-custody.ts` answers "did the platform receive this order's
 * money" for every gateway. COD is the one method it could not answer, because
 * the answer is not a property of the payment at all — it is a property of who
 * physically handed the goods over. A vendor's own van collects into the
 * vendor's pocket; the platform's courier collects into the platform's.
 *
 * So the answer is resolved once, at order creation, and STAMPED on the
 * consignment (`subOrders[].codCollectedBy`). Three reasons it is frozen
 * rather than looked up later:
 *
 *  - custody must stay a pure function of the order, or its Mongo mirror in
 *    `payment-custody.ts` cannot exist;
 *  - a merchant who changes the setting must not silently rewrite who owed
 *    whom on every historical order — the same reason `currency` is frozen at
 *    checkout;
 *  - the payout and commission queries have to be able to filter on it.
 *
 * Deliberately free of `server-only` and of any import beyond the config
 * enums, so it is testable and usable from both a query builder and a form.
