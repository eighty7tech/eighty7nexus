/**
 * Where a refund goes when it cannot go back the way it came.
 *
 * A card refund has an obvious destination: the card. Cash on delivery has
 * none — nobody took a payment instrument, so there is nothing to reverse. Up
 * to now Eighty7Nexus answered that by returning `{ gatewayCalled: false }` and
 * marking the return `manual_required`, which is a note to a human that reads
 * "you sort it out". Nowhere did it record WHERE the money should go, and
 * nothing ever moved the return off `manual_required`, so a shop could not
 * answer the only question that matters afterwards: have we actually paid this
 * person, and if not, to what account?
 *
 * These are the rules for that, kept pure and dependency-free so the return
 * form, the API and the admin screen all read the same ones.
 *
 * Store credit is deliberately absent. It is the obvious fourth destination
 * and every marketplace offers it, but it needs a balance the shopper owns and
 * a way to spend it at checkout — neither exists in Eighty7Nexus yet, and an enum
 * value nothing can honour is worse than one that is missing.
