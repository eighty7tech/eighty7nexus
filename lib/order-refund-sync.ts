/**
 * Keeping Eighty7Nexus's idea of a refund in step with the gateway's.
 *
 * Two things could happen at Stripe that Eighty7Nexus never learned about, and both
 * left the books describing money that had not moved the way they said.
 *
 * A refund issued from the STRIPE DASHBOARD — which is how a support team
 * actually refunds someone at three in the morning — produced no transaction
 * row, no ledger entry and no change to `refundedTotal` here. The order still
 * read as fully paid, so the vendor was still paid out in full for a sale the
 * shopper had already been given their money back for.
 *
 * And a refund can FAIL after the gateway accepts it: a closed account, a bank
 * that rejects the credit. Eighty7Nexus wrote every refund down as succeeded the
 * moment the API returned, so a failure left revenue reversed, the vendor's
 * payable clawed, and a shopper still out of pocket with nothing recording it.
 *
 * Both are handled by identity rather than by arithmetic. The gateway's own
 * refund id is matched against `PaymentTransaction.externalId`, so a refund
 * Eighty7Nexus raised itself is recognised as already recorded and a webhook that
 * arrives twice changes nothing the second time. Comparing amounts instead
 * would race with an in-flight in-app refund and record it a second time.
 *
 * Written once for every gateway rather than per gateway. Stripe, Paystack,
 * Razorpay and PayPal disagree about payload shapes, subunits and event names
 * and about nothing else — so each contributes an adapter that says which
 * order and which refunds, and the money handling below is shared. Pesapal is
 * the exception and needs none of this: its IPN already walks a reversal all
 * the way back through `reversePesapalOrder`.
