/**
 * Product boosting — feature gate + campaign lifecycle.
 *
 * Every campaign state transition lives here so the campaign status, its booked
 * BoostSlotDay rows and cache revalidation can never drift apart. All
 * transitions are CAS-guarded (filter on the expected current status) so
 * webhook/verify/cron races resolve to exactly one winner; losers return
 * quietly.
 *
 * Two rules run through the whole file:
 *
 *  - The storefront reads the CAMPAIGN, not a stamp. A booking's window is
 *    fixed at booking time and never rewritten by the cron, so a booking opens
 *    and closes at UTC midnight with no cron tick involved. Only bookkeeping
 *    (status, notifications, credits) depends on the cron.
 *  - Today is consumed, tomorrow is released. Every release passes TOMORROW as
 *    its floor: a day that has already served is billed, its BoostSlotDay row
 *    is the delivery record, and re-selling it would put two products in one
 *    visual slot on one calendar day.

 * going dark releases the inventory now rather than leaving a dead booking to
 * expire quietly weeks later.
 *
 * Today is never released — it has already served, its row is the delivery
 * record, and re-selling it would put two products in one visual slot on one
 * calendar day. Today's shortfall is handled by the sampling sweep instead,
 * which credits the fraction of the day that actually failed.
 *
 * A booking with nothing left to run is CANCELLED rather than truncated:
 * truncating would derive an end day at or before the start, and `updateOne`
 * runs without validators so the schema minimum would never fire.
