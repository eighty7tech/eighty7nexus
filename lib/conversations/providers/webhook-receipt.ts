/**
 * Idempotency for a provider webhook, shared by every surface that has one.
 *
 * Both Meta and Telegram redeliver an event until they get a 2xx, so a receipt
 * row is what stops the same message being ingested twice. The subtlety is what
 * a receipt that already exists actually means:
 *
 * - `processed` — genuinely handled; drop the redelivery.
 * - `processing` and recent — another worker still has it; drop the redelivery.
 * - `processing` and stale, or `failed` — the previous attempt died partway.
 *   This MUST be re-claimed, not dropped.
 *
 * Telegram used to treat every duplicate key as "already handled", so a
 * transient fault after the receipt row was written (a Mongo blip, a provider
 * profile lookup timing out) turned into permanent message loss: the row stayed
 * `processing`, the route answered 500, and every Telegram retry hit the unique
 * index and was discarded. Sharing this claim is what keeps the two webhooks
 * from drifting apart again.

/**
 * Whether an existing receipt means this redelivery should be discarded.

 * database plumbing. `failed`, and `processing` that has gone stale, both mean
