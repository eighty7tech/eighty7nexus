/**
 * Marks a channel connection as broken, and tells its owner exactly once.
 *
 * Two separate problems live here.
 *
 * The first is *idempotence*: a dead token fails every queued message on the
 * connection, so the demotion used to be written once per failed send. Guarding
 * the update on `status: active` turns that into a single edge — the first send
 * that discovers the outage demotes and notifies; the rest see a connection
 * that is already `error` and stay quiet.
 *
 * The second is *silence*: before this, a dying credential was recorded only in
 * `lastError`, which is rendered nowhere except the channels panel. A vendor's
 * WhatsApp could be down for days while the storefront kept advertising it.
 * Failed deliveries get a panel and unanswered chats get an escalation email;
 * an entire channel going dark deserves at least as much.
