/**
 * Per-vendor gross sales, aggregated live from orders.
 *
 * `Vendor.totalSales` is a dead column — nothing in the order flow ever
 * writes it — so every admin surface that shows a sales figure must derive
 * it from `subOrders`. The definition here matches the vendor's own
 * analytics dashboard (`/api/vendor/analytics`): sum of `subOrders.subtotal`
 * across non-cancelled orders, so the admin and the vendor see the same
 * number.
 *
 * Sales are grouped by the currency each order froze at checkout
 * (`Order.currency`). Adding a UGX subtotal to a USD one produces a number
 * that means nothing, and the UI formats the result with a single currency
 * symbol — so the buckets stay separate and the caller decides what to show.
 * Orders written before the `currency` field existed are attributed to the
 * store's current default currency, which is what they were charged in.
 *
 * That grouping is the one place the two surfaces can differ: a store that
 * changed its default currency mid-life has orders in both, and the vendor
 * dashboard still sums them at face value while these callers report the
 * store-currency bucket plus a breakdown. Single-currency stores — every
 * store that never switched — are unaffected.

 * One currency's worth of a vendor's trade.

 * All four come out of the same `$group`, so the header KPI and the Payouts
 * tab's lifetime strip cannot drift apart: "Total sales" is `grossSales` here.
 * `shipping` is what buyers paid this vendor's shipments — the platform keeps
 * it, since `vendorEarnings` is `subtotal - commission` with no shipping in it.
