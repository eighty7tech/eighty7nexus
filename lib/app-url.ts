 * Taken from the request rather than configuration so a store reachable on
 * several hostnames returns the vendor to the one they actually started on —
 * a checkout that completes on a different origin drops the session cookie and
 * looks like a failed payment.
 *
 * Duplicated in `app/api/vendor/boosts/checkout/route.ts` until this existed; a
 * `route.ts` may only export route handlers, so a shared helper cannot live in
 * one.
