 * Mandatory, not belt-and-braces: all six payment finalizers write
 * `PROCESSING` directly (`lib/stripe-orders.ts`, `paystack-orders.ts`,
 * `pesapal-orders.ts`, `razorpay-orders.ts`, `iotec-orders.ts`, plus the PayPal
 * capture and preorder-release routes). Hooking eight sites is eight chances to
 * miss one, and several sit inside gateway webhooks whose latency budget
 * belongs to the gateway.
