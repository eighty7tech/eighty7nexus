/**
 * What a refund was actually made of.
 *
 * A refund used to be one number. The ledger and the payout engine each had to
 * guess its composition, and both guessed the same way: prorate it across the
 * whole order. That is only ever right when the refund really is "X% of
 * everything" — and a return is the opposite, because a return is scoped to
 * particular items. On an 800 goods / 80 commission / 80 tax / 30 shipping
 * order refunded 880, the guess reversed 77.36 of the commission instead of
 * 80, left 2.64 of tax standing against a sale that came back, and clawed
 * 29.01 out of shipping income that was never refunded at all. On a split
 * order it was worse: the refund was spread across every consignment, so a
 * return of ONE vendor's item took money out of the other vendor's payable.
 *
 * So the composition travels with the refund instead of being re-derived. The
 * return request already computed it — `ReturnRequest.estimatedRefund` carries
 * the goods, tax and shipping split — and this module turns that into a
 * per-consignment allocation the posting rules can apply directly.
 *
 * Pure and free of database access, exactly as `lib/finance/postings.ts` is,
 * so the arithmetic is testable on its own.
