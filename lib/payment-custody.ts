/**
 * Who is actually holding an order's money.
 *
 * Every payout formula in this codebase assumes the platform collected the
 * money and is handing the vendor their share of it. For a cash sale that is
 * backwards: the merchant took the notes over their own counter, so they are
 * already holding 100% of the order — and the platform is the one owed its
 * commission, not the other way round.
 *
 * Paying such an order out anyway costs the platform twice: it sends the
 * merchant `vendorEarnings` in money it never received, AND it never collects
 * the commission it was owed. So this is the gate that decides whether an order
 * may enter a payout at all.
 *
 * Deliberately free of `server-only` and of any import, exactly as
 * `lib/locations/dispatch-order.ts` is: the rule is asserted in tests and is
 * needed by both a Mongo query and plain object checks.
 *
 * **Only affects marketplace mode.** The default (admin-owned) store is never
 * billed a commission and payout creation refuses it outright, so a
 * single-vendor install never reaches this rule.
 */

/**
 * The methods that settle onto the platform's own gateway credentials.
 *
 * An ALLOWLIST, deliberately, and it is the whole of the storefront rule. The
 * first version of this listed the self-collected methods instead and was
 * wrong within a day: `manual_pending` — the unpaid twin of `manual`, written
 * by the admin order form — was not on it, so those orders read as
 * platform-settled and stayed payable. A list of what to exclude fails open,
 * and failing open here means paying a merchant money that never arrived.
 *
 * So an unrecognised method is treated as the merchant's. Adding a gateway
 * means adding it here; forgetting to withholds a payout, which someone
 * complains about the same week. The alternative failure is silent and
 * permanent.
 *
 * Mirrors the checkout enum in `lib/validations/index.ts` minus `cod`.
