/**
 * Cart lines, grouped by who is actually selling them.

 * A marketplace cart is not one order. It splits per vendor at checkout, ships

 * the moment it holds two sellers, because `resolvePickupEligibility` answers
 * `multi_vendor`. Until now the shopper learned that on the checkout screen,
 * after filling in an address.
 *
 * Grouping is what makes the explanation self-evidencing: the sentence says
 * "items from 2 sellers" and the list above it shows exactly two groups.

 * looks at physical lines only because that is what decides collection — so
 * these two numbers can legitimately differ, and any copy printed next to the
 * groups must count the groups, not the sellers.
 *
 * The shopper built this list; reordering it under them makes the cart look
 * like it changed on its own. Lines within a group keep their original order
