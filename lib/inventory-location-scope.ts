 * Who a caller is acting as when they touch inventory locations.

 * an admin, a marketplace vendor, platform staff, and the POS register — and
 * each derives its owner differently. Resolving that in one place is what keeps
 * a read path and its matching write path from disagreeing about who owns what,
 * which is the failure mode that leaks one merchant's warehouses to another.
 *
 * Everything that queries `InventoryLocation`, or that accepts a `locationId`
 * from a client, must go through this module. There is deliberately no second
