 * the refund reservation that stops two concurrent refunds both passing the
 * cap (`PUT /api/admin/orders/[id]`), the same guard on both returns routes,
 * boost billing, preorder stock, and the charge-row re-sync. None of them can
 * be expressed as a plain `$set` without reading first and racing.
 *
 * Set globally rather than passed at each call: a pipeline update that forgets
 * the flag does not fail a type-check, it throws at runtime on a money path —
 * which is exactly how this was found, as a 500 from an admin order edit. One

 * and the wait shows up as latency on *every* surface at once, which reads
 * like "the whole site got slow" rather than "the database is busy".
 *
 * 50 suits a single app instance against a normal Mongo tier. Raise it for
 * heavier traffic (a mobile client on the same API, several app instances),

 * instances side by side, each building a pool of its own, so the real figure
 * is `instances × pool`. Twenty concurrent instances at 50 would ask for a
 * thousand connections and exhaust an Atlas M0 (500) — as connection errors on
 * checkout, at exactly the traffic peak that spawned the instances.
 *
 * Small pools are the right shape there anyway: an instance serves few
 * concurrent requests, so most of a large pool would sit idle while still
