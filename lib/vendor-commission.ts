/**
 * Vendor commission — the single source of truth for a vendor's effective
 * commission rate.
 *
 * `resolveVendorCommission` is a PURE function: callers pass already-loaded
 * docs, no DB reads happen here. Its result is written to `Vendor.commission`
 * (the enforcement cache) at write/seed moments only — vendor apply, admin
 * create, plan assignment, and subscription expiry. The order/payout path never
 * calls this; it reads the cached `Vendor.commission` number, so the money path
 * stays inert to plans.
 *
 * Precedence (highest → lowest):
 *   1. the default (admin-owned) store          → 0   (never billed)
 *   2. an applicable subscription plan           → plan.commissionRate
 *   3. settings.orders.commission.vendorRate     → the configured default
 *   4. DEFAULT_VENDOR_COMMISSION_RATE            → the built-in fallback
 *
 * A change to the SETTINGS rate reaches existing vendors through
 * `lib/commission-reprojection.ts`, which the settings save runs: it moves every
 * vendor still sitting on the old default and leaves per-vendor overrides alone,
 * which it can only do because `Vendor.commissionSource` records which of the
 * two a given number is.
 *
 * A change to a PLAN's `commissionRate` deliberately does not. Subscribers keep
 * `commissionRateSnapshot`, the terms they signed up under, across renewals —
 * the same grandfathering a boost gets from `boostTerms`. Editing a plan changes
 * what new subscribers are charged, not what existing ones are.
 *
 * The caller passes `plan` ONLY when it should apply (i.e. the vendor has an
 * active/trialing subscription to it); this keeps subscription-status logic out
 * of the resolver.
