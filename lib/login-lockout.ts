/**
 * Account lockout after repeated failed sign-ins.
 *
 * Admin → Settings → Security exposes "Max login attempts" and "Lockout
 * duration". Both were stored and rendered but read by nothing, so a merchant
 * could configure a lockout and have none: the only brute-force defence was
 * Better Auth's per-IP request rate limit, which is a different control with a
 * different shape. This module is what makes those two fields mean something.
 *
 * **The counter is keyed on email *and* client IP.** Locking on the email alone
 * is the textbook design and it hands anyone who knows the owner's address a
 * denial of service: fail five sign-ins every fifteen minutes and the store
 * owner never gets back in. Scoping to the IP as well stops the attack this
 * control exists to stop — one host grinding one account — without giving a
 * stranger a lever on someone else's login. The distributed case, many hosts or
 * many accounts, is covered by the shared rate limits in `lib/auth.ts`
 * (`/sign-in/email`: 8 per minute, database-backed so every instance shares one
 * budget).
 *
 * Every failed sign-in counts the same way whether or not the address belongs
 * to a real account — Better Auth answers 401 for both — so the lockout reveals
 * nothing about which emails are registered.
