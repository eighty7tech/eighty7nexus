 * delivery they had physically taken. Those are business decisions, and a
 * constant is not a decision — it is a decision nobody knew they had made.
 *
 * Every default here reproduces exactly that behaviour, so an install that
 * never opens the settings screen sees no change to a single figure. The
 * policies only do something once a merchant turns them on.
 *
 * Dependency-free and pure, like `lib/order-settings.ts`: the rules are read by
 * an API route, the refund allocation and the payout arithmetic, and they only
 * stay in step if all three read the same resolver.
