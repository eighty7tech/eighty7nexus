/**
 * Tell the merchant a shelf is now short.
 *
 * A replayed offline sale is accepted even when the stock is gone, because the
 * goods left the shop hours ago and refusing the record would only hide that.
 * What must not happen is the discrepancy going unnoticed until a stock count
 * weeks later turns up an unexplained variance with no way back to its cause.
 *
 * Routed through the payment-anomaly channel because it is the same kind of
 * event: an operational incident that bypasses routine notification
 * preferences, rather than a sales notification somebody might reasonably have
 * switched off. It carries the order so the merchant can open the sale that
 * caused it.
 *
 * Best effort by design — the sale is already committed, and a notification
 * failure must never turn a completed order into an error at the counter.
