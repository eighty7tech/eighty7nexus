/**
 * Receipt numbering for a sale taken while the connection was down.
 *
 * `generatePosOrderNumber` runs on the server and needs the database to keep
 * the sequence gapless, so an offline sale has no real order number yet. It
 * still has a customer standing at the counter waiting for a receipt, and that
 * receipt is what they will bring back for a return or an exchange — so the
 * number printed on it has to be findable afterwards.
 *
 * Hence a provisional number, printed now and stored on the order at sync time
 * alongside the real one. The alternative — reserving a block of server numbers
 * in advance — reads cleaner until a terminal is lost or reset mid-block, at
 * which point the sequence has a hole that someone has to explain to a tax
 * auditor.
 *
 * The terminal prefix is what keeps two counters from both printing `0007`.
