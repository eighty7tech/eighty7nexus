 * they are assigned to — which is what makes a one-location staff member skip
 * the picker entirely rather than being offered a choice they do not have.
 *
 * **Only active locations that sell over a counter.** Unlike the settings
 * dropdown, which passes `includeInactive=true` so a merchant can re-enable a
 * branch they closed, a register must never offer one: selling from a
 * deactivated counter is the thing deactivating it was meant to stop. And a
 * warehouse or a collection point is a location with no till — offering it
 * asks a cashier to say they are standing somewhere nobody stands.
 *
 * Returns an empty list rather than throwing. `resolveLocationScope` raises for
 * a store with no default vendor profile yet, and a register that has always
 * worked without locations must keep working — it simply sells from the shared
 * pool, exactly as it did before this file existed.
