/**
 * Which location this register is standing at.
 *
 * `settings.pos.defaultPosLocationId` is a single platform-wide field, but
 * locations are **per vendor** (see `models/inventory-location.model.ts`). Handed
 * straight to every terminal, it named the house store's counter on a vendor's
 * register — an id no product of theirs can ever carry a row for, so the whole
 * catalogue read 0 and the register was permanently "out of stock". The same id
 * then reached `decrementInventory` as a hard scope, so even an oversellable
 * line failed at the point of sale.
 *
 * So the configured id is only ever used by a terminal that **owns** it. A
 * merchant who doesn't stands at their own default location instead, and one
 * with no default stands nowhere — which reads as the plain aggregate stock,
 * the behaviour every register had before a location was configured at all.
 *
 * The platform setting stays the switch: with it unset no terminal is
 * location-scoped, exactly as today. Setting it is what says "registers sell
 * from a counter", and each merchant's own counter is the honest reading of
 * that for their register.
