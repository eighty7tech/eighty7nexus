 * Draining the offline outbox.

 * Replay is safe because every sale already carries `clientRequestId`, which
 * `POST /api/pos/orders` treats as an idempotency key (there is a unique
 * partial index behind it on `Order.posClientRequestId`). Re-sending a sale the
 * server already committed returns that same order rather than ringing up a
 * second one, so the only real question is what to do when the server says no.
 *
 * That question has a hard constraint: by the time a queued sale is replayed
 * the goods have left the shop and the money is in the drawer. Nothing here may
 * silently drop a sale, and nothing may retry forever a sale the server will
 * never accept. So refusals are split in two — retry what is transient, raise
 * what is not — and a raised sale stays in the queue until a human deals with
 * it.
