/**
 * The register's product filter, evaluated locally.
 *
 * When the counter loses its connection the grid must keep answering the same
 * questions `GET /api/pos/products` answers online — search, category, stock
 * status — against the catalogue snapshot in IndexedDB. This mirrors the query
 * in `listPOSProducts`, field for field, so a cashier does not see one set of
 * results before the network drops and a different set after.
 *
 * Scoping is deliberately *not* repeated here. Which products this register may
 * sell at all (vendor ownership, `publishing.pointOfSale`, per-location stock)
 * is decided on the server and baked into the snapshot; re-deciding it client
 * side would be a second implementation of an authorization rule, and the one
 * that ran on untrusted ground. The snapshot contains only sellable products,
 * so this only narrows.

/**
 * Mirrors the server's `$or`: name and SKU match loosely, barcodes exactly.
 *
 * A barcode is scanned, not typed, so a substring match on it would let a short
 * numeric search pull in unrelated products — which is why the server keeps
 * those two fields exact while the rest are regex.
 *
 * The needle is the RAW search, deliberately not `sanitizeSearchString`'d. That
 * helper escapes regex metacharacters because the server interpolates the term
 * into a `$regex`; an escaped `\(Large\)` still matches the literal text there,
 * but passed to `includes()` it matches nothing — so applying it here would
 * make the offline grid *narrower* than the online one for any product with a
 * bracket or a dash in its name.
