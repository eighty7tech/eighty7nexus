/**
 * What a return is worth, worked out in one place.
 *
 * This arithmetic used to live inside `POST /api/returns`, wrapped around a
 * database write, which made it unreachable from a test and unreachable from
 * the shopper — who submits a return without ever being shown the figure the
 * reason they picked produces. Pure and dependency-light, like
 * `lib/refund-allocation.ts`, so the sums can be checked on their own and
 * quoted back before anything is created.
 *
 * The rule the whole thing turns on: a return is either the merchant's failure
 * or the shopper's choice, and the deductions only belong on the second.
