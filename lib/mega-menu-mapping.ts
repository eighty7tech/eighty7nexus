/**
 * Mega-menu payload mapper, kept apart from the regular header-link mapper on
 * purpose.
 *
 * A regular header link is edited through a single "Icon / image" field that
 * writes `image`, so its mapper has to fall back to `image` when `icon` is
 * empty — drop that fallback and every header link loses its icon.
 *
 * A mega-menu item carries two independent assets: `icon` comes from the
 * synced category, `image` is the side banner the promo panel draws. Running
 * those through the regular mapper collapsed them into one, and that is what
 * silently killed the banner — `getMegaItemPromoImage` discards an image that
 * equals the icon, so a category with a banner and no icon of its own rendered
 * no promo at all.
