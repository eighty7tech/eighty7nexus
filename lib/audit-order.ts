/**
 * Order lifecycle audit events.
 *
 * The admin order Timeline renders `AuditLog` rows for `resource: "order"`.
 * Before these helpers existed only two admin endpoints ever wrote such a row,
 * so the card showed nothing for a POS sale, nothing for a card payment, and
 * nothing for a refund — the three things an operator most needs to see.
 *
 * Two properties every helper here holds to:
 *
 * 1. **It never throws.** `audit()` already swallows its own errors and returns
 *    null; these wrappers add no failure mode of their own. An audit write must
 *    not be able to fail a checkout or a webhook.
 * 2. **The summary is self-contained.** `getOrderTimeline` selects only
 *    `action`, `createdAt`, `userEmail` and `changes.summary` — deliberately,
 *    because audit rows carry whole before/after documents the card never
 *    shows. So the summary string must read as a complete sentence on its own.
 *
 * Most of the order lifecycle runs with no admin session (gateway webhooks,
 * payment finalizers, storefront checkout), which is what `systemActor()` is
 * for — the timeline renders those as "by System".
