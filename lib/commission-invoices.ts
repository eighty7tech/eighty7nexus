/**
 * Collecting commission the platform never got to deduct.
 *
 * A payout is the platform handing a vendor their share of money it already
 * holds. For a cash sale that direction does not exist: the merchant took the
 * notes at their own counter, so they hold all of it and the platform is the
 * one owed. `lib/payment-custody.ts` decides which sales those are; this module
 * turns the resulting balance into something collectable.
 *
 * It deliberately mirrors `POST /api/admin/payouts` rather than inventing a
 * second bookkeeping style: raise a row, CLAIM the sub-orders onto it so
 * nothing else can bill them, and roll the claim back if the row does not
 * survive. The claim is what makes the balance safe to show — an amount that
 * two invoices could each collect is worse than no amount at all.
 *
 * The invoice is the DEBT. Payment attempts are separate `PlatformPayment` rows
 * pointing back at it (kind `commission`), exactly as boost attempts point at a
 * campaign — so a vendor abandoning one checkout and completing another leaves
 * two attempts behind without either the amount or the claimed sales moving.
