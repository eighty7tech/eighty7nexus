/**
 * Resolve the owner scope for an upload from the signed-in user.
 *
 * A marketplace that stores every vendor's media in one flat date tree cannot
 * answer the questions it eventually has to answer: how much space is this
 * vendor using, what do we bill them, and what do we delete when they leave.
 * Scoping the key at write time is the only cheap moment to fix that — once
 * the objects exist, attributing them means walking the whole catalogue.
 *
 * Derived here, on the server, from the session. The client's `customPath` is
 * validated for shape but not ownership, so it can never be the source of this
 * value: a vendor could otherwise file uploads under a rival's prefix.
 *
 * Returns undefined for admins and customers — their uploads (store branding,
 * review photos, avatars) belong to the store, not to a vendor, and keeping
 * them unscoped leaves the existing key layout untouched.
 *
 * The role check is what makes that true, and it is not just an optimization.
 * In single-vendor mode the admin owns the default vendor record, so looking
 * the caller up by userId alone filed the store's own logo and banners under
 * `vendor/<default vendor id>/` — the opposite of what this promises. It also
 * spends a query per upload on customers, who can never have one.
