/**
 * What a sold unit cost the seller, frozen onto the order line.
 *
 * An order is a historical record and `Product.cost` is not: a supplier price
 * rises, someone edits the field, and every margin ever reported for that
 * product silently changes with it. Reading cost back through the product at
 * report time therefore cannot produce a true figure for last month — only for
 * a hypothetical month where today's cost always applied. The only fix is to
 * copy the number at the moment of sale, exactly as `price`, `name`, `sku` and
 * the customs snapshot are already copied.
 *
 * Precedence mirrors `resolveCurrentItemPrice`: a variant's own cost wins,
 * because `Product.cost` on a variant product is the parent's figure and can be
 * wrong for the specific unit sold.
 *
 * **Absent is not zero.** A store that has never filled the cost field must
 * report "margin unknown", not "margin = 100%". So this returns `undefined`
 * rather than 0 when nothing is recorded, the schema field has no default, and
 * every reader has to handle the gap. That distinction is also what lets a
 * finance report name the period before cost tracking began instead of
 * printing a confident, false profit for it.
