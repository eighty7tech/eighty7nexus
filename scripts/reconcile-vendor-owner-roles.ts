/**
 * Realign every vendor owner's `user.role` with the vendor record they own.
 *
 * `Vendor.status` and `user.role` record the same fact in two places, and for a
 * long time only the admin approval endpoint wrote both. Every path that
 * brought a store back from the billing side — a Stripe webhook, a one-shot
 * gateway confirmation — restored the vendor document alone. An owner demoted
 * by the suspension before it therefore stayed a `customer`: their storefront
 * kept selling and taking orders, while every `/vendor/*` page bounced them to
 * `/become-vendor` and offered them a signup wizard for the store they were
 * still paying a subscription on.
 *
 * The activation paths now repair the role themselves and the vendor area
 * guard heals a drifted request in place, so this script is for the accounts
 * that drifted before those landed. It is idempotent — running it on a healthy
 * store writes nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO IS DEMOTE. A user holding `vendor` whose store is
 * suspended, rejected or gone is reported and left alone: taking a role away
 * cuts off a live merchant, the data cannot say whether an admin meant it, and
 * the mistake is not one an admin would notice until the merchant complains.
 * Promotion restores access the vendor record already says they are owed;
 * demotion is a decision, and decisions belong to whoever made them.
 *
 * Admin and staff owners are skipped by `decideVendorOwnerRoleRepair` — their
 * roles answer to a different lifecycle and `setUserRole` would overwrite it.
 *
 *   tsx --env-file=.env scripts/reconcile-vendor-owner-roles.ts           # report
 *   tsx --env-file=.env scripts/reconcile-vendor-owner-roles.ts --apply   # write
