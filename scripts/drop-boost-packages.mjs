/**
 * Remove what the flat-fee boost model left behind.
 *
 * Boosts are no longer bought as a package with a duration — a vendor books a
 * numbered ladder position for a range of UTC days — so every row written under
 * the old model describes a product that no longer exists. Those rows are not
 * merely stale, they are actively misleading: a campaign carrying a
 * `packageSnapshot` has no `positionSnapshot`, no `startDay`, no `billedDays`
 * and no BoostSlotDay rows, so the storefront cannot render it, the cron cannot
 * reconcile it, and every lifecycle path looks broken while it sits there.
 *
 * The feature never shipped, so there is deliberately no conversion: a flat-fee
 * campaign cannot be mapped onto a rung without inventing which rung it bought.
 *
 * `pnpm db:reset` does not list these collections either, so they survive a
 * full reset — on a self-hosted product every buyer would otherwise inherit
 * them forever.
 *
 * Also unsets `boosting.maxPerVendorPerPlacement`. It refereed an
 * undifferentiated random shuffle; under a ladder a vendor holding two rungs
 * paid for both, and capping post-hoc would mean charging for a position and
 * then not rendering it. The settings save silently drops unknown keys from the
 * payload and never `$unset`s the stored document, so removing it from the code
 * leaves the value behind.
 *
 * PlatformPayment rows are deliberately untouched: they are the money record,
 * and a paid attempt whose campaign is gone is exactly what an audit needs to
 * see. `refundedAmount` on them still reads correctly on its own.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:migrate:drop-boost-packages:dry     # report only, writes nothing
 *   pnpm db:migrate:drop-boost-packages
