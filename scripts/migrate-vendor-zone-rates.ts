/**
 * Move vendors off their own shipping geography and onto the store's zones.
 *
 * Vendors used to draw their own zones (countries, regions and rates), which is
 * the Etsy model. The store now defines the zones and a vendor supplies only
 * what it charges inside each one — the Dokan/Mirakl split — so a shopper's
 * address resolves to the same zone whichever vendor they buy from, and a
 * vendor who has configured nothing still ships everywhere the store does.
 *
 * A legacy vendor zone cannot be matched to a platform zone by id (both sides
 * generated their own), so it is matched by the geography it describes: the
 * platform zone sharing the most countries with it, preferring one whose regions
 * also overlap. Rates from every legacy zone mapping to the same platform zone
 * are concatenated, keeping their ids.
 *
 * Vendor zones that match no platform zone are LEFT BEHIND and reported. They
 * describe places the store does not zone at all, so there is nothing to attach
 * their prices to — the store's fallback will cover those addresses instead.
 *
 * `lib/shipping.ts` keeps rating unmigrated vendors the old way, so running
 * this is safe at any time and re-running it is a no-op.
 *
 * Run with --dry-run first: the report says how many vendors carry rates the
 * store has no zone for, which is a question for the admin, not for a script.
