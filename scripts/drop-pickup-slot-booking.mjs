/**
 * Remove what the pickup slot-booking system left behind.
 *
 * Pickup no longer takes appointments — a shopper collects during the branch's
 * opening hours — so two collections and six per-branch settings now describe a
 * feature that does not exist. On a self-hosted product every buyer would
 * otherwise inherit them forever: `pnpm db:reset` does not list the collections
 * either, so they survive even a full reset.
 *
 * The `$unset` is not optional. `defaultPickupLocation()` wrote slot length,
 * capacity, lead time, booking horizon and blackout dates into EVERY branch a
 * merchant ever created, including ones that never took a booking — so these
 * keys are present in essentially every database, not just deliberately
 * configured ones.
 *
 * Orders are deliberately untouched. `Order.subOrders[].fulfillment.pickup`
 * keeps its historical `reservationId`, `startAt`, `endAt` and `timeZone` so
 * every order booked while the system existed still shows the window it booked.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:migrate:drop-pickup-slots:dry     # report only, writes nothing
 *   pnpm db:migrate:drop-pickup-slots
