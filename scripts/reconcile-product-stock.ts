/**
 * Realign `stock` with the per-location quantities underneath it.
 *
 * A product carries the same number three times — the `locationInventory` rows,
 * `variant.stock`, and the product's own `stock` — and each is derived from the
 * one below. They fell out of step because `buildProductAggregateUpdate` (the
 * only thing keeping them aligned on the `findOneAndUpdate` path the product
 * PUT uses) summed `variant.stock` while ignoring the location rows beneath it.
 * That is fixed; this repairs what drifted before it was.
 *
 * Why it matters even though nothing looks wrong today: the next ordinary
 * product save recomputes `stock` from the rows, so the difference appears all
 * at once as stock a merchant never added. Doing it here, deliberately and with
 * a printed before/after, is the difference between a reconcile and a mystery.
 *
 * WHICH NUMBER IS RIGHT IS NOT KNOWABLE FROM THE DATA, so this script refuses
 * to guess. A product whose locations sum higher than its `stock` was sold from
 * before it tracked locations: the sale lowered `stock` alone, and whoever
 * later typed the location counts may have counted the shelf before those sales
 * or after. Only the merchant knows which.
 *
 *   --source=locations   the counted shelf is right; raise `stock` to match.
 *                        Risks re-selling units that already shipped.
 *   --source=stock       the running total is right; lower the rows to match.
 *                        Risks understating what is actually on the shelf.
 *
 * `--source=stock` is the safer default choice for a live store, because
 * overselling takes money for goods that are not there. Neither is applied
 * without being named, and the direction is honoured for simple products and
 * variant products alike.
 *
 * When the rows are what move, they are rescaled in proportion to what they
 * already hold (see `distribute`) — never below zero, and never by dumping the
 * whole difference onto one branch. Every row that changes is printed, so a dry
 * run shows the actual writes rather than just the per-variant total.
 *
 * A SIMPLE product that tracks no locations is left completely alone — there is
 * no second number to reconcile its `stock` against. A variant product is always
 * checked: its `stock` is Σ(variant.stock) whether locations are in use or not,
 * and only the variant rows underneath it are a direction question.
 *
 * Separately, and under both directions, a product that has variants gets its
 * PRODUCT-level location rows cleared. Nothing reads them once variants exist
 * (see `ghostLocationRows`), and leaving them is how a later variant deletion
 * resurrects units nobody counted. The discarded figure is printed per row.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:migrate:reconcile-stock:dry -- --source=stock
 *   pnpm db:migrate:reconcile-stock -- --source=stock
