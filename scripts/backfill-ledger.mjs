/**
 * Replay history into the ledger.
 *
 * The ledger starts empty on an existing store, so every report would begin at
 * the moment the feature shipped. This walks the documents that already record
 * money — paid orders, refunds, cleared payouts, platform payments, purchased
 * labels — and posts each through the SAME rules the live paths use.
 *
 * Safe to run repeatedly. Entry keys are derived from the source document, so a
 * second run collides with the unique index and writes nothing; there is no
 * "already done" flag to get wrong, and a run interrupted halfway is simply
 * resumed by running it again.
 *
 * It writes only to the ledger. No order, payout or payment is touched, so the
 * worst case of a mistaken run is entries that can be dropped and rebuilt.
 *
 * **`--rebuild` is for when a posting RULE changed.** Idempotency is the whole
 * design here, and it cuts both ways: an entry written under an old rule keeps
 * its key, so a plain re-run collides with it and the stale entry survives
 * forever. Rebuilding deletes the order and refund entries in scope and posts
 * them again. It is the only way to correct the books after a rule
 * fix, and it is deliberately a separate flag, because on any other day it
 * deletes good data to write the same thing back.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:migrate:ledger:dry     # counts what it would post, writes nothing
 *   pnpm db:migrate:ledger
 *   pnpm db:migrate:ledger -- --from=2026-01-01
 *   pnpm db:migrate:ledger -- --rebuild --method=cod    # after a rule change
