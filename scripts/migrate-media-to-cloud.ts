/**
 * Move media off this server's disk and into the configured storage provider.
 *
 * Local storage was retired in v1.5. Files already written to `public/uploads/`
 * and `private-uploads/` keep being served — the /uploads/* route reads them
 * straight off the disk — but they are stranded there: nothing new can join
 * them, and the next deploy that replaces the app folder takes them with it.
 * This is the way out.
 *
 * What it does
 * ------------
 * 1. Uploads every file under `public/<pathPrefix>` to the configured provider
 *    under the SAME object key, so nothing about the layout changes except
 *    where the bytes live.
 * 2. Uploads every file under `private-uploads/` the same way. Digital-product
 *    deliverables are referenced by key, not URL, so those references keep
 *    working untouched.
 * 3. Rewrites the public URLs across the database: every `/<pathPrefix>…`
 *    string becomes the provider's absolute URL for that same key.
 *
 * Why the database sweep is generic rather than a list of fields: media URLs
 * are spread over ~23 models, some nested inside arrays (product variants,
 * blog content, chat attachments), and a hand-written field list is exactly
 * the kind of thing that silently misses one and leaves a broken image behind.
 * Every collection is walked instead, and only strings that resolve to a file
 * this run actually uploaded are touched.
 *
 * Safety
 * ------
 * - `--dry-run` reports the whole plan and writes nothing.
 * - A file that fails to upload is never added to the rewrite map, so its
 *   URL keeps pointing at the local copy that still works.
 * - Local files are NEVER deleted. Verify the store, then remove them by hand.
 * - Re-running is a no-op: the second pass finds no `/<pathPrefix>` URLs left.
 *
 * Known limit: migrated objects keep their original keys, so historical media
 * is not filed under `vendor/<id>/…` the way new uploads are. Attributing an
 * existing file to a vendor means guessing from whichever document happens to
 * reference it, and a wrong guess is a broken image — not worth it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:migrate:media-to-cloud:dry
 *   pnpm db:migrate:media-to-cloud
