/**
 * Put a point on every collection branch, so "near me" has something to measure.
 *
 * Radius search used to run over `Vendor.address.geo` — a payouts/KYC address,
 * routinely an accountant's office or a home in another city. It now runs over
 * `InventoryLocation.geo`, the place a shopper actually walks into. Branches
 * created before that field existed carry no point at all, which means they are
 * reachable only through the coarse city fallback until this pass runs.
 *
 * Default pass is purely local and makes no network calls: each branch inherits
 * its own vendor's geocoded address, which for the overwhelming majority of
 * merchants — one shop, one address — *is* the branch.
 *
 * Pass --geocode to additionally resolve each branch's own free-text address,
 * which is strictly better information than the vendor's when a merchant runs
 * more than one place. Opt-in because it costs one Nominatim call per branch at
 * roughly one per second, per their usage policy.
 *
 * Run --dry-run first. The report is the point: the share of collection points
 * carrying a real pin is what decides whether "Pickup near me" is worth
 * surfacing on this install at all.

 * Nominatim degrades a query it cannot match by dropping parts until only the

 * centroid. That is indistinguishable from a genuine answer by shape — but a
 * branch 200 km from its own merchant's registered address is far more likely
