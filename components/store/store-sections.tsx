/**
 * Render a page's section instances through the registry.
 *
 * Data-fetching sections get their own <Suspense> boundary (the definition
 * supplies the skeleton) so the shell streams immediately and each section
 * pops in independently; synchronous sections render inline — the exact
 * boundaries the hand-wired home page drew.
 *
 * Documents can outlive code in both directions, so unknown section types
 * render nothing rather than crash, and every instance is re-normalized
 * against the CURRENT definition before rendering.
 *
 * Which component actually runs is decided in this order:
 *
 *   1. the instance's own VARIANT — a stored merchant choice, so it wins;
 *   2. a per-theme override for the type;
 *   3. the section's base renderer.
 *
 * Variants outrank themes on purpose: "I picked the promo-row design for
 * this shelf" must survive switching theme, or the choice is not a choice.
