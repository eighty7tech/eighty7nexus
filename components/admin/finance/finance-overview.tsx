/**
 * The profit and loss, and what the business is holding.
 *
 * Everything on this screen is a grouping of the ledger — the point of having
 * built one. Three things are deliberate and easy to get wrong:
 *
 * GMV sits apart from revenue and is labelled as volume, because on a
 * marketplace most of it belongs to vendors; the admin dashboard has been
 * calling that number "revenue" and this screen is where the distinction
 * finally shows up.
 *
 * Nothing is summed across currencies. Each currency the store has traded in is
 * a separate set of books, and it is chosen rather than stacked: sections one
 * under another read as a running total to anyone scrolling, which is the one
 * reading that is never true.
 *
 * The figures are grouped by the question they answer, not by their shape. A
 * screen of sixteen identical tiles has no hierarchy — every number arrives at
 * the same volume, so the one that matters (net) has to be found rather than
 * seen, and a balance that cannot be true looks exactly like a healthy one.
