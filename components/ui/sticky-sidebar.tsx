/**
 * A sidebar that scrolls with the page until its own end, then stays put.
 *
 * `position: sticky` alone can only pin a column by its top, which is right for
 * a short one and wrong for a tall one: the moment the page scrolls, the top
 * group is frozen under the header and everything past the fold — the last
 * facets, the sort list — becomes unreachable without scrolling back up. Giving
 * it its own `overflow-y` instead trades that for a second scrollbar the
 * shopper has to find, on a platform whose overlay scrollbars are invisible
 * until touched.
 *
 * So the offset is measured rather than fixed. A column that fits on screen
 * rests below the header for the whole scroll. A column taller than the screen
 * gets a `top` far enough negative that it travels up with the page until its
 * *bottom* reaches the viewport, and pins from there — the shopper reads
 * through the whole panel on the way down and keeps the end of it in view
 * afterwards.
 *
 * The measurement re-runs on resize and whenever the panel's own height changes
 * — collapsing a filter group is exactly that.
