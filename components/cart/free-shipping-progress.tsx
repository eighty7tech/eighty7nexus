 * zone-based rates keeps the old threshold value in its settings but the rate
 * engine never reads it, so rendering the bar there would promise free delivery
 * the shopper then gets charged for at checkout. Stores on zone rates express
 * the same thing per zone with a `free_over` rate, which is a different number
 * and only applies to the zone the address falls in — not something the cart can
 * state before it knows the address.
